/* A few notes:
   - The information on stroustrup.com is outdated.

   - When you have found the up to date version (github)
     then copy the source code into notepad and save as
     std_lib_facilities.h.

   - If you are using the mingw64 compiler, save the file into
     the include folder within that directory. You can probably
     do the same within the Visual Studio directory 
     too. 
     C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.33.31629\bin\Hostx64\x64

   - This should enable you to include "std_lib_facilities.h".
